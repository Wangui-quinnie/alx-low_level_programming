C Algorithm

Learning objectives
A search algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or method for locating a specific item within a collection of items, such as data structures or databases. The goal of a search algorithm is to find the presence or absence of a target element within the given collection.

Linear Search:
Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that iteratively checks each element in the collection until a match is found or the entire collection is exhausted. It starts at the beginning and moves through the elements one by one until the target element is located.

Binary Search:
Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm, but it requires the collection to be sorted. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the target element is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half; if greater, it continues in the upper half. This process is repeated until the target is found or the search interval becomes empty.

Best Search Algorithm:
The best search algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the requirements of the search. Here are some considerations:

Linear Search:

Suitable for small collections or unsorted data.
Simple to implement.
Requires iterating through all elements, making it less efficient for large datasets.
Binary Search:

Ideal for large sorted collections.
Significantly faster than linear search for large datasets.
Requires the data to be sorted initially, and any updates to the collection may need re-sorting.
Hashing:

Efficient for large datasets where direct access to the elements is needed.
Requires a good hash function and can have collisions.
Interpolation Search:

Suitable for uniformly distributed datasets.
Faster than binary search for datasets with a non-uniform distribution.
Exponential Search:

Effective for large datasets with unknown size.
Requires the collection to be sorted.
Choosing the best search algorithm involves considering factors such as the size and nature of the dataset, whether the data is sorted, and the trade-offs between time and space complexity. Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the specific use case and requirements.

12. Jump search in a singly linked list
You might think that linear search is not as effective as any other algorithm, right? Well, we should see what happens with a singly linked list.

Please define the following data structure in your search_algos.h header file:

/**
 * struct listint_s - singly linked list
 *
 * @n: Integer
 * @index: Index of the node in the list
 * @next: Pointer to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 */

You can assume that list will be sorted in ascending order
If value is not present in head or if head is NULL, your function must return NULL
You have to use the square root of the size of the list as the jump step.
You can use the sqrt() function included in <math.h> (don’t forget to compile with -lm)
Every time you compare a value in the list to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example)
NOTE: You can find here the functions used in the example. You don’t need to push them, we will compile your file with our own implementation during the correction.

13. Linear search in a skip list
As you see now, looking for a specific value in a singly linked list always leads to browse every element of the list. A common way to optimize the time complexity of a search in a singly linked list is to modify the list itself by adding an “express lane” to browse it. A linked list with an express lane is called a skip list. This change does not come without consequences. Indeed, the space complexity of a search in this kind of list will grow as sizeof(skiplist_t) > sizeof(listint_t) (see example below).

Please define the following data structure in your search_algos.h header file:

/**
 * struct skiplist_s - Singly linked list with an express lane
 *
 * @n: Integer
 * @index: Index of the node in the list
 * @next: Pointer to the next node
 * @express: Pointer to the next node in the express lane
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure with an express lane
 */
typedef struct skiplist_s
{
    int n;
    size_t index;
    struct skiplist_s *next;
    struct skiplist_s *express;
} skiplist_t;
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted skip list of integers.

Prototype : skiplist_t *linear_skip(skiplist_t *list, int value);
Where list is a pointer to the head of the skip list to search in
A node of the express lane is placed every index which is a multiple of the square root of the size of the list (see example below)
And value is the value to search for
You can assume that list will be sorted in ascending order
Your function must return a pointer on the first node where value is located
If value is not present in list or if head is NULL, your function must return NULL
Every time you compare a value in the list to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)
NOTE: You can find here the functions used in the example. You don’t need to push them, we will compile your file with our own implementation during the correction.
